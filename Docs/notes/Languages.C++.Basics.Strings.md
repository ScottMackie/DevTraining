# Strings  

A String is collect of characters like this, `"This is a string"`.  

Declaring a string is done like `string str1;`.  
String is accessed via the `<string>` header.  
This library has many functions.  

## Examples of functions  

### .append()
```cpp
string3 = string1.append(string2);
```  
`.append()` does exactly what it says, it appends a string on to another string.  

### .length()
```cpp
cout << "The length using .length() of the txt string is: " << txt.length() << endl;    
```
`.length()` returns the length of the string.  

### .size()
```cpp
cout << "The length using .size() of the txt string is: " << txt.size() << endl << endl;
```
`.size()` works the same as `.length()`, returning the size of the string.

### Access element of string
```cpp
cout << "You can access single charater of a string like this:  The 4th letter is " << txt[3] << endl;
```  
`txt[x]` you can access a single elementsof a sting like accessing a element of an array.
